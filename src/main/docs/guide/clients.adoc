By default R2DBC is not opinonated about clients, therefore you can use the R2DBC `ConnectionFactory` with any https://r2dbc.io/clients/[external R2DBC client] you choose.

=== RxJava 2 Client (Experimental)

As part of this project there is an experimental RxJava 2 client which you can add with the following dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.r2dbc:micronaut-r2dbc-rxjava2[version="{version}]

Which allows you to inject a `RxConnectionFactory` bean that allows you to do basic operations with R2DBC and RxJava 2.
